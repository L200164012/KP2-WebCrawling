Don't forget to install geckodriver and make sure your Path is correct, so the selenium's script will recognize that the dependencies already fulfilled

In windows you just need to download geckodriver from here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
Then you must add path manually, I.e. 'C:\<Where your geckodriver.exe is>\geckodriver.exe'

To run the code as webservice you'll need:
1. 127.0.0.1:8000/main  --> For making first run
2. 127.0.0.1:8000/fix    --> For fixing the error, i.e, browser accidentaly exit
